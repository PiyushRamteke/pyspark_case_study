Danny Ma has this amazing [8 Week SQL challenge]( https://8weeksqlchallenge.com ) which consist of 8 case studies. 
I have picked up the first case study [Danny's Diner](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/) as project to demonstrate my understanding of Pyspark. 
I have used Databricks Community Edition for it where I solved it using Dataframe and SQL.


## Solution

## SQL skills gained
- Aggregations
- Joins
- CTEs
- Window functions
- Ranking (ROW_NUMBER, DENSE_RANK, RANK)
- CASE WHEN statements

Happy Learning
